            <p/>
                Managed a project for a dental implant system following 
                design controls and collaborated with a cross functional 
                team to achieve 510(k) clearance of a Class II device. 
                Worked with Regulatory department to ensure that deliverables 
                and testing meet or exceed applicable regulatory and quality 
                standards. Created the CAD models for system components 
                including implants, analogs, screws, abutments, copings, 
                and more. Created the technical drawings for each model 
                following geometric dimensioning and tolerancing standards. 
                Worked closely with manufacturing to create prototypes, 
                update drawings, and successfully manufacture components 
                at high volume.

            <div class='card  border-0'><p/><strong>Scan Body:</strong><br/><p/>

            Completely redesigned the scan body to improve the 
            scanning and orientation for the designing of custom 
            dental components. Updated drawings and routed engineering 
            change orders for scan bodies of each implant system and 
            each size available. Designed and executed experiment for 
            testing different materials for the scan body and created 
            a report of the results.

            Took on a new responsibility in the department to manage 
            CAD libraries. Learned how to use three different dental 
            CAD software. Developed procedure for creating, organizing, 
            testing, and transferring CAD libraries to the production 
            team. Became the go to person to solve problems in production 
            related to dental CAD design and continuously worked well under 
            pressure to resolve problems quickly.

            Assisted in the development of a novel surgical 
            device used for the connection of tubular structures 
            in the body. Worked in a clean room to assemble prototypes 
            and improve assembly procedures of the device. Researched 
            microsensors to be used for wireless connection to ensure 
            safe coupling of the magnetic device.

            Lead project team for the product line extension 
            of the assisted surgical planning system. Researched
            equipment, performed ROI analysis, and selected equipment 
            for 3D printing the anatomical models. Communicated with 
            the FDA and regulatory consultants for guidance on standards 
            for 3D printed medical devices. Created and compiled documentation 
            for the design history file. Reviewed and updated SOPs from 
            the quality management system to ensure standards were met. 
            Collaborated with manufacturing team to develop and execute 
            IQ, OQ, and PQ protocols.
