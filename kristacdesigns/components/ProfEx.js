            Welcome to my personal website! My name is Krista Camero, 
            and I am a mechanical engineer with a strong background in design, 
            research and development, and project management within the medical device industry.
            What truly drives me is the pursuit of innovation and sustainability. 
            While my expertise lies in the medical device industry, I am eager to explore career opportunities 
            in industries that share my passion for innovation, responsible resource usage, and sustainable 
            manufacturing practices. I believe that as engineers, we have a unique opportunity to shape a better 
            future by developing groundbreaking solutions that address pressing global challenges.
            One of my core areas of expertise lies in CAD modeling. With 7 years of experience, I possess a comprehensive skill set in creating precise and detailed 3D models. Using advanced software tools, I am able to bring my ideas to life, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in the design process. 
            Designing and creating are not just professional endeavors for me, they are a true passion. In my spare time, I immerse myself in personal projects, exploring new ideas and pushing the boundaries of my creativity. I have set up a dedicated workspace at home, complete with a 3D printer. This allows me to bring my concepts to reality and continuously refine my skills as a designer and maker.
            Thank you for visiting my website. I invite you to explore my portfolio, where you can discover examples of my work and projects.

            <p/>
                Managed a project for a dental implant system following 
                design controls and collaborated with a cross functional 
                team to achieve 510(k) clearance of a Class II device. 
                Worked with Regulatory department to ensure that deliverables 
                and testing meet or exceed applicable regulatory and quality 
                standards. Created the CAD models for system components 
                including implants, analogs, screws, abutments, copings, 
                and more. Created the technical drawings for each model 
                following geometric dimensioning and tolerancing standards. 
                Worked closely with manufacturing to create prototypes, 
                update drawings, and successfully manufacture components 
                at high volume.
